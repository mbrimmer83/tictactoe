##  Project Overview
The Tic tac toe game was designed to introduce me to basic javascript logic, JQuery, and interacting with the DOM by creating a two person playable game. The goal of the project was to create a playable game and that would check for a winner after every move and show if there was a winner. Have a reset button that allowed another game to be played after the winner was determined.

##Technologies and languages:
  Langauges:
    Javascript, HTML, CSS.
  Technologies.
    Jquery
    
## Learning Outcomes:
  This was my first time using Jquery and I became comfortable with the syntax as well as targeting classes. I had to get the values of each square and set the values. I also had to lock each button after it was selected. This was my first introduction ti the Document Object Model and I gained a decent understanding of it. The project also continued to expand my knowledge of HTML and CSS.
